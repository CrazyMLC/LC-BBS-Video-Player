# LC BBS Video Player

This is both a player and encoder of video. Put in a video file, and a javascript file gets spit out, ready to render that video in stunning detail on the Sawayama Powerlance.
Inspired by the work of [ethanhjennings](https://github.com/ethanhjennings/last-call-bbs-video-player), who made a funny joke which I decided to make less funny.

# How To Use

To make your own servers (in order words, videos to play in Last Call BBS) you must drag and drop video files into video.py.
If you don't like dragging and dropping, you can run it in command line by providing a video file as the first argument. There are no other command line options. (even though there should be.)

If the script doesn't work, make sure You're using Python 3 and have installed the requirements.

If you need help with anything else, many of the tips included in ethanhjenning's project are relevant to this one as well.
